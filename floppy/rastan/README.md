## Historical Context

Rastan represents an important era in gaming history when arcade games were being ported to home computers. The 5¼-inch floppy disk format was the standard for Japanese PC gaming in the late 1980s, and Taito's careful attention to packaging and labeling helped establish the game's premium feel.

The multi-disk format (A/B, C, D) was necessary due to the game's size and complexity, with each disk containing different levels and assets. This distribution method was common for Japanese PC games of the period, especially those converted from arcade machines.

## Printing Instructions

To recreate these labels for your own 5¼-inch floppy disks:

1. **Paper Type**: Use high-quality adhesive label paper designed for floppy disks
2. **Print Settings**: Print at 300 DPI or higher for best quality
3. **Size**: Ensure the label fits the standard 5¼-inch floppy disk label area
4. **Application**: Carefully align and apply the label to avoid air bubbles
