# Hack The Planet!

[<img src="https://media.tenor.com/K8R7LThju04AAAAC/hack-the-planet.gif">]

I was wondering to have some cool stickers and fabric patches with some cool
floppy disk logos. So I've started to created those floppy images with the
iconic phrase "Hack The Planet!" on it.

I couldn't decide which one was better, so I'm saving here all versions I've
created with DALL-E model.

Several I edited on [GIMP](https://gimp.org), and split the images on layers so
you can combine or change the skull's or mix everything in the way you want.

Here's all the work I have so far with those images. You will find several
versions, some differs slightly from the other, some are completely different.

Go ahead and explore, I'm using mostly for stickers, t-shirts, and fabric
patches in my backpacks.

#### Artwork

All artwork was created with [inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) artwork files
will always be available as `.svg` in the [art directory](art). In additional
some `.xcf` files are also available to be used with [GIMP](https://gimp.org).

Some scanned versions can also be found in the [art directory](art).

#### 5¼-inch diskettes
