# Diskclub

This is an old Brazilian company which distributes games and softwares on
diskettes in a computer magazine.

Here I'm adding the original stamp I've found in one of my old 5¼-inch diskettes.

You'll find the original scanned file in the [original directory](original)

#### Artwork

All artwork was created with [inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) artwork files
will always be available as `.svg` in the [art directory](art). In additional
some `.xcf` files are also available to be used with [GIMP](https://gimp.org).

Some scanned versions can also be found in the [art directory](art).

- Here are some of the artwork files, and what's used for:

- [art/disk-clube-pirate-extracted.jpg](art/disk-clube-pirate-extracted.jpg) -
  The original pirate extracted from the original scanned version
- [art/diskclub.svg](art/diskclub.svg) - All artwork with tracemaps versions
- [art/bitmap-traced-pirate.svg](art/bitmap-traced-pirate.svg) - The pirated
  bitmap traced in inkscape
- [art/bitmap-traced-smooth-pirate.svg](art/bitmap-traced-smooth-pirate.svg) -
  The pirated with a smooth bitmap trace without modifications
- [art/bitmap-traced-smooth-pirate-1.svg](art/bitmap-traced-smooth-pirate-1.svg)
  - The smooth copy of the pirated but with a few modifications in the cartoon
- [fdd312/grey-floppy-layered-diskclub.xcf](fdd312/grey-floppy-layered-diskclub.xcf) - A 3½ floppy image with the diskclub images

#### 5¼-inch diskettes

For 5¼ diskettes the original diskclub stamp is provided without any changes.

#### 3½-inch floppy disks

For those floppy's I've recreated a label, to be printed or modified.
Those can be found in the [directory fdd3½](fdd312).
